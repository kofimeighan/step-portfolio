    <h3><b>Who am I?</b></h3>
      <p> My name is Kofi Meighan, and I am from Boynton Beach, Florida. I 
        began my ventures within Computer Science when I was very young and 
        I didn't even know it. I saw coding in action when I would program 
        lego robots to move a designated period of time, a set number of 
        rotations, or a very precisely calculated number of radians. 
        That was the start, and finally being able to apply my skills to 
        projects that will advance technology and positively develop 
        someone's experience is what continues to fuel me to learn and make 
        change throughout the world.
